<h1>Caveats on the smarty parser</h1>
<h2>->Endless loop on widget</h2>
<p>If a page ends with {/widget} with no space or newline, it loops indefinitely. May affect other tags. Just add a space.</p>
<h2>->Reserved strings and some function calls</h2>
<p>First off, it doesn't like keywords like null. I just add a $ so it parses it like a variable, and fix it later. Also, there
are a few allowable calls such as empty() that I hadn't accounted for.</p>
<h2>->Strings and variables</h2>
<p>By dumb luck, embedding "$variables in strings" works. However, I do not know if smarty allows this in single quotes, in which
case our luck will have run out. </p>
<p>Some tags parameters have optional value quoting...ok, let me step back. {widget type=pane} is as valid as {widget type='pane'},
I did not design the parser to keep track of how it parsed this value. So after parsing it, it quotes it without any metadata.</p>
<p>You may or may not have seen smarty using backticks to embed variables in strings, "menu/`$menu`" for instance. This has worked
out to be really annoying with the quoted parameter values, be prepared to fix unquote '$admin . "/path"' because the quoter doesn't
reallize that it functions as a string. A fix is probably a waste of time but if you fix it I will thank you.</p>
<p>Time to rip on smarty, smarty seems to let by unclosed or unopened quotes. This is something I certainly had not expected, but
get ready to fix {widget type=pane'} where the code has been that way for years and never cared. My parser cares so fix it!
</p>
<h2>->Wierd function syntax</h2>
<p>The biggest one I noticed here is the implementation of concatenation as a function that is infinitely repeatable. My parser
will yell at you if you attempt to do multiple functions in one tag.</p>
<p>like: {$var|wierdfunction_syntax} will work, but {$var|wierdfunction_syntax|chained|multiple|times} will not work.</p>
<p>Also I didn't think to make the variable parser store the elements in a highly manipulatable state. This might be a good
thing to do: instead of parsing and building a parsed string, it should create a data set of some sort, so that when we get a 
function such as 'cat', we can tell the parser to return $main . '.' . $args[0]; At the moment, it holds main and args as
comma separated values.</p>
